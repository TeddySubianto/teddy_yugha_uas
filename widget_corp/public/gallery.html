		Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

			There's fast n there also is faster even fastest. 
			The New A7 chip gives you CPU and graphics performance up to 2x faster than the A6 chip.
			Even more impressive, A7 akes Iphone 6 the first 64-bit smartphone in the world
			(desktop class architecture in a supersmart phone). 
			And because iOs7 was built specially for 64-bit, 
			it's uniquely designed to take the advantage of the A7 chip			
			</td>

			A7 supports OpenGL ES version 3.0 to deliver the kind of detailed graphics and complex visual effects once possible only on Mac computers, PCs, and gaming consoles. 
			The difference is amazing. Take the imaginary worlds in games, for instance. 
			Textures and shadows look more true to life. Sunlight reflects off the water. 
			The whole experience feels much more realistic.

		With iPhone 6, getting into your phone is faster, easier, and even a little futuristic.
